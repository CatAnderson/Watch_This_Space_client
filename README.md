# Educational SPACE Discovery App (and game)

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing an interactive space browser applications that will allow children to learn about the planets a fun and clickable way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

## MVP

A Primary School child should be able to:

- View the planets as part of the solar system. 
- A child should be able click each planet to find out some cool information about that planet
- Allow the child to take a quiz based on the planet information
- Be able to interact with the page between solar system and planet details and finally atking a quiz on the knowledge learned.


## Extensions

- solar animation...
- media query to allow child to play on full range of media environments - tablet to desktop.
- Make a game allowing the child to traverse the solar system (basic Mathematical challenges or memory game) for the child to explore space.
